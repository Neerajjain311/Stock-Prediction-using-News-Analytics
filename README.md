# Stock-Prediction-using-News-Analytics
Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. 
Several technical and social factors influence the stock market. 
All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy. 
With the drastic improvements made with respect to computation power, proposed system looks forward to analyze and predict the movement of stock prices using recent news articles and historical data.

This approach will work with historical data about the stock prices of a publicly listed company. It implements a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of this company, starting with Sentiment Analysis and ARIMA.

Broadly, this architecture is considering stock market analysis to be divided into the following parts –
1.	Technical Analysis

Technical Analysis, includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market. This approach takes the time series data and just try to predict future behaviour based on the statistical models. However, say the stocks for reliance industries remained pretty constant for years but surged to high rates with the success of Jio (Telecommunications division). Such instance is not captured in and needs to work upon which bring us to the next analysis part

2.	Behavioural Analysis

Behavioural Analysis or Fundamental Analysis involves analyzing the company’s future profitability on the basis of its current business environment and financial performance. It involves prediction based on the market behaviour considering various parameters like what are the company policies, government interventions, etc. to capture the exact behaviour for the stocks of a particular company.
